# Workplace Web Component Library

> Made with create-react-library (https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library)

- [Rollup](https://github.com/rollup/rollup)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

It also features:

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to help you create and show off your components
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) enabling testing of the components


## Install

### Installing Component Library Locally


```bash
npm install --save git+https://github.com/annpod/library.git // change the path after publishing to npm
```

which will install the local component library as a dependency in application. It'll then appear as a dependency in `package.json` like:

"devDependencies": {
  "workplace-web-component-library": "git+https://github.com/annpod/library.git" // change the path after publishing to npm
  ...
}
 
Your components can then be imported and used in the project.

import { MyComponent } from 'workplace-web-component-library'


### Component Code Splitting

Code splitting of your components is not supported by default.

```
import MyComponent from 'workplace-web-component-library/build/src/MyComponent';
```

There are some changes we have to make to rollup.config.js

input: [..., "src/MyComponent/index.ts"],

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react'

import { MyComponent } from 'workplace-web-component-library'

class Example extends Component {
  render() {
    return <MyComponent />
  }
}
```


### Supporting Image Imports

Add the following library to your component library [@rollup/plugin-image](https://github.com/rollup/plugins/tree/master/packages/image):

```
npm i -D @rollup/plugin-image
```

Then add it to `rollup-config.js`:

```
...
plugins:[
  ...,
  image(),
  ...
]
...
```

You can then import and render images in your components like:

```tsx
import logo from "./rollup.png";

export const ImageComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <img src={logo} />
  </div>
);
```

## Development

Create a component

import React from 'react'

export const MyComponent = (props) => (
  <div>{props.title}</div>
)

Add export to src/index.ts (used as the entry point for Rollup). We use a pattern called Barrel Exports to expose our components in the entry point. We do this by importing, then exporting all our components. Components exported here are bundled by Rollup

import { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';

export {
  ...,
  MyComponent
}

### Story

Create a stories for MyComponent. Open src/MyComponent/MyComponent.stories.tsx and place

import React from "react";
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

export default {
  title: 'Components/MyComponent',
  component: MyComponent
} as Meta;

const Template: Story = (args) => <MyComponent {...args} />;

export const Primary = Template.bind({});

Primary.args = {  
  title: 'Hello World'
};

### Testing

```
npm run test
```

### Building

```
npm run build
```

### Storybook

To run a live-reload Storybook server on your local machine:

```
npm run storybook
```

Storybook will run and load up components at http://localhost:6006


To export your Storybook as static files:

```
npm run storybook:export
```
